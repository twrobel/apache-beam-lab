    "When we work on a _batch_ (e.g. a `.csv` file) we are dealing with a _bounded_ input. There are a finite number of records \n",
    "in our `PCollection`. Working with a bounded input comes naturally to most people, so much so that there are a number of \n",
    "concepts that we probably take for granted when doing so. For example, imagine you are processing a `.csv` file containing\n",
    "the scores that players recorded on an online game. The `.csv` file is published daily (the number of records in the file\n",
    "vary from one day to the next). Say you wanted to determine the average score for players aged 16-18? You could perform \n",
    "a `GroupByKey` operation on the `PCollection` records where the key `16 >= age <= 18` and calculate the `mean`. In this \n",
    "scenario, we usally assume that the `GroupByKey` operation will be performed on _all_ of the matching records in the \n",
    "`.csv` file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider an alternative scenario where the data arrives as a stream via a Kafka Topic. In this scenario our input is \n",
    "_unbounded_; there are an infinite (or potentially infinite) number of records in our `PCollection`. We can't  simply \n",
    "declare a `GroupByKey` operation on the stream where `16 >= age <= 18`, because these types of records could keep \n",
    "arriving forever (apparently, a lot of teenagers are playing video games these days). Instead, we also need to declare a\n",
    "_boundary_ on the data we want processed. Windows! Windows let us explicitly define boundaries on our input data. \n",

    "\n",
    "Given a timestamped `PCollection` we declare a window to capture all of the elements whose timestamps lie within the \n",

    "for the players in our online game. We might expect to see bursts of data for each player, followed by gaps with no \n",

    "use a global window on streaming data, under a couple of circumstances:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You aren't performing any aggregation operations in your pipeline. For example, if your pipeline is performing simple \n",
    "transformations on individual `PCollection` elements as they arrive on the stream. \n",
    "- You provide a non-default `Trigger` for the global window. Triggers are the mechanism used by Beam to determine when \n",

However, note that windowing considers only the implicit timestamps attached to each element of a PCollection, and data sources that create fixed data sets (such as TextIO) assign the same timestamp to every element. This means that all the elements are by default part of a single, global window.\n",
